# DSAR-Automation-MVP

**DSAR Automation App**
Automate Data Subject Access Requests (DSARs) using Google Sheets and Apps Script.

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates a lightweight **DSAR automation prototype** for GDPR compliance. It allows organizations to:

* Capture DSARs from users
* Automatically send acknowledgment emails
* Track requests in a Google Sheet
* Categorize requests by type (Access, Deletion, Correction)

This is a **working prototype** that doesn’t require backend hosting, making it ideal for demos or MVPs.

---

## Problem Statement

Organizations must respond to DSARs under GDPR within strict timelines. Manual handling of requests can be slow, error-prone, and difficult to track.

**Solution:** Automate DSAR handling using Google Sheets + Apps Script to streamline intake, acknowledgment, and tracking.

---

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend / Input:** Google Forms (optional, linked to Sheets)
* **Backend / Processing:** Google Apps Script
* **Database / Storage:** Google Sheets
* **Email Automation:** Google Apps Script `MailApp`

## User Stories

| Feature                              | User Story                                                                                               | Acceptance Criteria (AC)                                                    |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Intake**                           | As a data subject, I can submit a DSAR with my email and request type so I can exercise my rights.       | Form required fields; confirmation email sent.                              |
| **Workflow**                         | As a compliance officer, I can move a request through New → In Review → Completed to track progress.     | Status visible in Requests sheet; DueDate auto-set to +30 days.             |
| **Discovery/Collection (simulated)** | As a compliance officer, when I complete a request, the system gathers subject data from source systems. | Matching rows by Email are included in the package.                         |
| **Redaction**                        | As a compliance officer, the output redacts PII.                                                         | Email masked, names partially masked, phone masked (all but last 2 digits). |
| **Delivery**                         | As a data subject, I receive a secure data package.                                                      | Email with ZIP containing PDF + JSON.                                       |
| **Audit**                            | As a privacy lead, I can see a log of key actions.                                                       | Audit tab records RequestCreated and PackageSent with timestamps.           |

---

## Success Metrics

* Lead time per request (form → delivery) under **1 day** (demo)
* **Zero manual copy/paste** from source tabs (fully scripted)
* **100% auditable** (Audit tab entries)
* Basic **redaction applied consistently**

---

## Key Features

* **DSAR Intake Form:** Capture user name, email, and request type
* **Automatic Acknowledgment Emails:** Sends confirmation when a request is submitted
* **Request Tracking:** Google Sheet stores all requests with status updates
* **Categorization:** Requests labeled as Access, Deletion, or Correction
* **Automation:** Apps Script automatically processes pending requests and updates the sheet

---

## How It Works (Workflow)

```
[User Form Submission] → [Google Sheet] → [Apps Script]
            ↓                       ↓
    Request Stored           Auto Email Sent
            ↓                       ↓
        Status Updated        Request Tracked
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create Google Sheet**

   * Name: `DSAR_MVP`
   * Columns: `Timestamp | Name | Email | Request Type | Status | Response Sent`

2. **Create Google Form (Optional)**

   * Fields: Name, Email, Request Type
   * Link Form responses to the Google Sheet

3. **Add Apps Script**

   * Extensions → Apps Script
   * Paste the following code:

```javascript
function sendAcknowledgmentEmails() {
  const sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName("DSAR Requests");
  const data = sheet.getDataRange().getValues();

  for (let i = 1; i < data.length; i++) {
    let row = data[i];
    let status = row[4];
    let responseSent = row[5];

    if (status === "Pending" && responseSent !== "Yes") {
      let name = row[1];
      let email = row[2];
      let requestType = row[3];

      MailApp.sendEmail({
        to: email,
        subject: "DSAR Request Received",
        body: `Hi ${name},\n\nWe have received your ${requestType} request and will process it shortly.\n\nThank you.`
      });

      sheet.getRange(i + 1, 6).setValue("Yes");
      sheet.getRange(i + 1, 5).setValue("In Progress");
    }
  }
}
```

4. **Set up Trigger**

   * Go to **Triggers → Add Trigger**
   * Function: `onFormSubmit`
   * Event: On form submit

4. **Set up Trigger**

   * Go to **Triggers → Add Trigger**
   * Function: `onEdit`
   * Event: On edit

---

## How to Run / Test

1. Submit a new request via the Google Form
2. Observe auto-generated **Status** and **Response Sent** in Requests sheet
3. Change Status → Completed to trigger DSAR package creation and email delivery
4. Verify **Audit tab** for logged actions

---

## Key Learnings / Impact

* Automated DSAR process reduces **manual work** and **human errors**
* Fully implemented in **Google Workspace**, no external servers required
* Provides **audit logs** for compliance verification
* Demonstrates **end-to-end product thinking**: intake → processing → delivery → compliance

If you want, I can also **create a professional workflow diagram image** for GitHub and give you the Markdown to embed it in this README. It will make your repo visually polished and presentation-ready.

Do you want me to do that next?
